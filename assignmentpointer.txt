Ans.  p is a pointer and q is an integer. 
Q3: Find the output of the following code snippet. 
int a = 10, b = 20; 
int *ptr = &a; 
b = *ptr + 1; 
ptr = &b; 
cout << *ptr << ‘ ‘ << a << ‘ ‘ << b; 




Ans.  11 10 11 


Q4: Find the output of the following code snippet. 
int a = 15, b = 20; 
int *ptr = &a; 
int *ptr2 = &b; 
*ptr = *ptr2; 
Ans.  ptr now points to b 
Q5: Is the following program snippet correct?
int a = 10, b = 20; 
int *ptr; 
*ptr = 5; 
No, because *ptr does not contain any address. It has a garbage value.
